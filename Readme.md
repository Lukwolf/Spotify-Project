# Top Streaming Songs Spotify

### Introduction
Our subject domain is the digital music streaming industry, which includes platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, etc. We have decided to specifically explore this data through the lens of Spotify’s metrics that were collected and assembled into our chosen dataset. We are interested in demystifying the top-performing songs on Spotify’s platform in correlation with different attributes of the dataset (i.e. popularity with a particular or combination of attributes, amongst attributes themselves, etc.) The significance of this problem is that Spotify has multitudes of data which can be shared with artists in order to improve their likelihood of creating a top streaming song (which may be different than a song that does well in in-person concert environments) by giving creators valuable insights into how top performing songs are formulated and assembled. This in turn will help growing artists and increase the likelihood of artists who use data-based decision making to create top streaming music.

### Dataset
The dataset we have retrieved is from Kaggle (Elgiriyewithana, 2023) and is in a structured, tabular format (.csv file), with rows representing songs and columns representing different variables of the songs. This dataset was collected for the year of 2023 starting from January 1, 2023 to August 26, 2023.
This dataset was retrieved by the publisher leveraging the digital music streaming platform’s API such as Spotify’s Web API. It is due to this, that the dataset was able to include Spotify proprietary metrics. There is no behind-the-scenes access that would enable us to discover how these metrics were calculated, as it is within the realm of intellectual property and is patented. We have permission to use this dataset in alignment with a Creative Commons License which allows us to use, share, and adapt the dataset for our educational purposes.

### Guiding Questions

##### Data Visualization
Preamble: There are audio-specific features that are quantifiable measures (e.g. bpm, key, mode) and there are spotify-specific features that were generated by Spotify’s proprietary algorithms that provides percentile value (0-100%) for different descriptive ratings of the songs’ valence, danceability, energy, etc.
Focused guiding questions 1 and 2:
1. What proportion of popular songs share the same audio-specific features (e.g. bpm)?
2. Which of these Spotify-specific metrics (e.g. danceability) correlates best with the
number of streams?
Significance: The significance of these two questions lies in how it can provide a valuable business insight for artists and record labels on Spotify’s streaming platform and want to learn how to optimize their product. Essentially every music creator is interested in generating as many streams as possible since it will increase the value of their brand as well as generate revenue per stream. Knowing which dataset features can be repurposed into key performance indicators for top-streaming music will act as a guiding hand in creating a musical recipe that tends towards being highly successful on average.
Preamble & Significance: Spotify, Apple Music and various other platforms all provide music streaming services. Potentially, they are responsible for driving the popularity of any music and likely boost the streams on not just their own platforms but on others as well. Therefore, we aim to analyze the possibility of any synergy between the presence of the music across different platforms, on their charts and playlists as well.
Focused guiding question 3:
3. How are the number of streams on Spotify related to the number of playlists the song has
been added to (Spotify’s own platform vs its competitors like Apple Music)?

##### Statistical Analysis
For our first statistical question we would like to look at two variables, the number of artists and the number of streams. We would like to determine if songs that have multiple artists (2 or more) have more streams than songs with a solo artist on average. Then we would use the student's t-distribution and/or bootstrapping to determine this. Our second statistical question would be to investigate possible linear relationships amongst Spotify proprietary metrics (Ex. Energy (0-100% values) against acousticness (0-100% values)). For this we will use scatter plots/heatmaps to visualize any linear relationships. Then for a pair that demonstrates some reasonably strong linear relationship, we will perform a single-variable linear regression model to further investigate this. Our third statistical question we would like to look at is doing a proportion test between the populations of multiple vs. single artist songs, we then would go ahead and convert the speechiness % column into a categorical variable with songs having a a speechiness % of over 0.50 being labeled with “1” for strong speechiness and the rest being labeled with a “0.” We will then conduct a conventional prop.test and/or bootstrapping simulations in order to get to our final results for this question.
     
### Tasks
We will be performing the following data wrangling; removing missing values, stripping whitespace from strings, dropping columns that do not provide value, converting columns from categorical to numerical data types, changing the datatype of columns (eg.string to numerical conversion), indexing/slicing to retrieve relevant information, and normalizing the values between 0 and 1 into percentages. After a thorough review of this dataset, all of this data wrangling will be necessary in order to retrieve information that is relevant towards the desired analyses.
Some data visualizations we are interested in exploring are bar plots in order to compare difference categories, scatter plots in order to visualize relationships between 2 different variables, correlation matrices with heatmaps to see the correlations of the variables in a more visual way, histograms in order to visualize the distribution of different variables and possibly other plots.
We will be using pandas & numpy to deal with vectorized computation over structured, tabular data, matplotlib in order to visualize data, algebraic operators in order to perform basic mathematical operations to transform the data into more suitable format and datetime in order to work with dates in an easier and more efficient way.

### Conclusion

#### Data Visualization
In conclusion, our project focused on analyzing top-performing songs on Spotify's platform in 2023, aiming to uncover valuable insights for both artists and Spotify. Through our exploration of guiding questions, we discovered several key findings. First, we found that there is no dominant mode or BPM range for top-streaming songs, indicating that artists need not feel pressured to choose one over the other when creating music. Second, our analysis of Spotify-specific metrics and their correlation with the number of streams revealed inconclusive evidence of strong linear relationships, suggesting that popularity on Spotify is influenced by various factors, making it challenging to predict success based solely on these metrics. Lastly, we observed a positive correlation between the number of streams and the number of playlist adds, indicating that as songs become more popular, they tend to appear on more playlists. However, this relationship weakens as the number of streams increases, and playlist adds start to taper off for hyper-popular songs. In the future, research in this field could explore the influence of other external factors, such as marketing strategies, artist popularity, or cultural events, on the streaming performance of songs. Additionally, further investigation into the dynamic nature of success on streaming platforms and its impact on artists' decision-making processes could provide valuable insights for the music industry. Overall, our project opens the door to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics that drive music streaming trends, empowering artists to make data-based decisions in their quest to create top-streaming music.

#### Statistical Analysis
In conclusion, our data exploration and analysis have unveiled essential findings and insights within the realm of Spotify's top-performing songs in 2023, guided by our three fundamental questions. For our first question, the results of our hypothesis testing led to an intriguing revelation: we could not reject the null hypothesis, indicating that, on average, solo songs appeared to have stream counts equal to or surpassing those featuring two or more artists. This finding highlights the intriguing possibility that multiple artists may not guarantee a higher stream count, potentially reshaping how we perceive the success of solo artist songs and multi-artist collaborations. In response to our second question, the data and statistical tests have provided compelling evidence. Songs with multiple artists, on average, tend to exhibit a higher proportion of high speechiness scores compared to songs with a single artist. While our analysis demonstrates a correlation, the complex dynamics of causation may warrant further exploration. Our examination of the seven Spotify proprietary metrics, as addressed in our third question, has brought to light a notable negative linear relationship between acousticness and energy. Our rigorous assessment of underlying assumptions, including normality of residuals and homoscedasticity, confirms the reliability of our linear model. The results of the F-test further underscore the statistical significance of our model, affirming the influential role of 'acousticness' on 'energy.' Finally, our heatmap correlation analysis identified a single robust relationship among the metrics examined. As we reflect on these discoveries, we recognize the profound complexity and diversity of top-streaming music in today's world. Our exploration of multi-artist collaborations, the intricacies of Spotify's audio metrics, and the acknowledgement for external factors to influence song performance prompts us to envision a wealth of untapped possibilities in the field of music analysis. We believe that research in this field could explore the influence of external factors such as marketing strategies, artist popularity, or cultural events on the streaming performance of songs. Further investigation into the dynamic nature of success on streaming platforms and its impact on artists' decision-making processes could provide invaluable insights for the music industry. Our journey into the world of data-driven music insights has just begun, and we eagerly anticipate the path ahead, teeming with opportunities for deeper exploration and ground-breaking discoveries.
